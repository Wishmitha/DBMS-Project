**Description :**

Exacutor is a web based application to monitor the extracurricular activities performed by the students of Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Students can add activities which can be verified by the assigned supervisors. Individual and group reports can be generated by the system to monitor the performances of the students. 

**Implementation :**

The default object relational model (ORM) of the Laravel framework hasn't been used. Instead an object relational model is implemented in the backend using model classes. MySQL is used to query out the data from the database and the data is passed between the controllers and the views as model objects.

**Development :**

Bootstrap studio was used to develop web interfaces. Seperate controllers are implented to build up the connection between the models and the views. Therefore MVC architecture is presereved in the developement process. HTTP request based routing structure is created for page transitions. A seperate database schema was developed using MySQL.
